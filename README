0. Your goal is to modify your copy of bits.c so that it passes all the
tests in btest without violating any of the coding guidelines.

1. What you should do 
    a. read instructions in bits.c carefully.
    b. modify the first function in bits.c to meet the requirements.
    c. run ./check
        i.   if you break the coding rules, you will see warnings beginning with "dlc"
        ii.  if build process is failed, errors/warnings will be seen.
        iii. if your function fails in passing a testcase, you may see 
            "ERROR: test f(A, B, ...) failed. 
            Given RESULT_YOURS, should be RESULT_STANDARD"
            where f is the first failed function. 
            [A, B, ...] is the testcase arguments calling the function
            RESULT_YOURS is results returned by YOUR implementation.
            while RESULT_STANDARD is the correct one.
        iv. if there's no bug in your implementation, 
                then you may see ERROR of the NEXT function. JUST KEEP GOING!
    d. if all is done, feel free to try ./finalreport
    e. there are 2 (useless) helper functions. refer to original-README for details.
2. ENJOY IT!
